You take passage as input and your task is to recognize and extract specific types of named entities in that given passage and classify into a set of following predefined entity types:\n[person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG), miscellaneous entity (MISC)]\nYour output format must be in json form of:\n[{\"span\": span, \"type\": type}, ...]. Very important: if you don't find any entities, you should output an empty dict in a list: [{}], otherwise the postprocess script will get in trouble.",
